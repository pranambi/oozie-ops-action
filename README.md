# cdp-ops-action

GitHub Actions workflows to manage CDP cluster operations — Oozie job control and shell script execution. Replaces direct edge node access with a controlled, auditable, and approval-gated interface.

## Why this exists

Previously, admins and data scientists SSHed into the CDP edge node to run Oozie commands and shell scripts manually — no audit trail, no approval, no visibility. These workflows provide a controlled alternative entirely within GitHub.

---

## Workflows

### 1. Oozie Operations — Environment-aware (`oozie-ops.yml`)

Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI. Includes an **environment selector** (Prod / Test-deploy).

- Operation and environment selected from dropdowns
- Kill and Restart require approval via `cdp-production` environment
- Stale approvals older than 5 minutes are automatically rejected
- Separate audit files per environment: `audit/audit_log_Prod.csv` and `audit/audit_log_Test-deploy.csv`

**How to trigger:**
1. Go to **Actions** → **Oozie Operations** → **Run workflow**
2. Select environment, operation, and enter Job ID
3. For Kill/Restart — approver must approve before execution

---

### 2. Oozie Operations — Basic (`oozie-ops-basic.yml`)

Manual trigger. No environment selector — runs against Oozie regardless of environment since both Prod and Test-deploy share the same Oozie server.

- Simpler trigger — just operation and Job ID
- Kill and Restart require approval via `cdp-production` environment
- Audit: `audit/audit_log_basic.csv`

**How to trigger:**
1. Go to **Actions** → **Oozie Operations (Basic)** → **Run workflow**
2. Select operation and enter Job ID

---

### 3. Oozie Operations — PR-based (`oozie-ops-pr.yml`)

GitOps approach. Edit `requests/request.yaml`, raise a PR — **merging the PR is the approval and triggers execution**.

- Best for planned operations where a review trail before execution is needed
- PR review replaces the approval gate
- Reason for the operation is documented in the request file
- Audit: `audit/audit_log_pr.csv` + full git history as permanent trail

**How to trigger:**
1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b ops/<operation>-<job-id>`
2. Edit `requests/request.yaml` with the operation details and reason
3. Push and raise a PR
4. Reviewer approves and merges — operation executes automatically

---

### 4. Script Runner (`script-runner.yml`)

Runs shell scripts directly on the CDP edge node. Data scientists add scripts to `scripts/`, raise a PR — merging triggers execution.

- Script runs as the user specified in the `# RUN_AS:` comment at the top of the script
- If no `# RUN_AS:` is set, runs as the default runner user
- PR review is the approval gate
- In production: set `runs-on: self-hosted` to run on the actual CDP edge node
- Audit: `audit/audit_log_scripts.csv`

**How to run a script:**
1. Add your script to `scripts/` with `# RUN_AS: <user>` at the top
2. Create a branch, push, raise PR
3. Reviewer approves and merges → script runs on the edge node

> Note: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` is set for demo. Change to `self-hosted` after installing the GitHub Actions runner on the CDP edge node.

## Secrets required (when connecting to real CDP)

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `OOZIE_URL` | Oozie server URL e.g. `http://cdp-edge-node:11000/oozie` |
| `CDP_USERNAME` | CDP cluster username |
| `CDP_PASSWORD` | CDP cluster password |

Set these in: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
